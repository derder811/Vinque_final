# Deployment Guide

## GitHub Pages Deployment

This project is configured for automatic deployment to GitHub Pages using GitHub Actions.

### Automatic Deployment

1. **Push to main branch**: The deployment workflow will automatically trigger when you push changes to the main branch.

2. **GitHub Actions Workflow**: The `.github/workflows/deploy.yml` file contains the deployment configuration that:
   - Installs Node.js and dependencies
   - Builds the project using `npm run build`
   - Deploys the `dist` folder to GitHub Pages

### Manual Deployment

You can also deploy manually using the npm script:

```bash
npm run deploy
```

This command will:
1. Build the project (`npm run build`)
2. Deploy the `dist` folder to the `gh-pages` branch

### Setup Requirements

1. **Repository Settings**: 
   - Go to your GitHub repository settings
   - Navigate to "Pages" section
   - Set source to "Deploy from a branch"
   - Select "gh-pages" branch and "/ (root)" folder

2. **Base Path Configuration**: 
   - The `vite.config.js` is configured with the correct base path for GitHub Pages
   - Base path is set to `/pro/` (your repository name)

### Project Structure

- `dist/` - Production build output (generated by `npm run build`)
- `.github/workflows/deploy.yml` - GitHub Actions deployment workflow
- `vite.config.js` - Vite configuration with GitHub Pages base path

### Troubleshooting

- **404 Error**: Make sure the base path in `vite.config.js` matches your repository name
- **Build Fails**: Check that all dependencies are installed and the build command works locally
- **Deployment Fails**: Verify GitHub Pages is enabled in repository settings

### Local Development

```bash
# Install dependencies
npm install

# Start development server
npm run dev

# Build for production
npm run build

# Preview production build
npm run preview
```
